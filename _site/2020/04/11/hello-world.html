  <p class="lime-hl">11 Apr 2020 - omshi</p>

  <p>It is 10:32PM on the 11th of April, 2020 and I have <strong>finally</strong>, after what I can only think of as, years of procrastination (it’s good that we have such a nice, formal sounding world for what can only be described as pathological laziness), I have finished setting up this blog.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to hear me write more about…stuff. (or not.)</p>
