It is 10:32PM on the 11th of April, 2020 and I have **finally**, after what I can only think of as, years of procrastination (it's good that we have such a nice, formal sounding world for what can only be described as pathological laziness), I have finished setting up this blog.

Stay tuned to hear me write more about...stuff. (or not.)
